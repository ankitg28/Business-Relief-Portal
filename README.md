Problem Statement: 

The economy of a country is significantly influenced by small companies By creating jobs, buying locally produced goods, paying sales and property taxes, and interacting with local businesses and support services, they contribute to local economies
Two-thirds of new jobs in the US are created by small businesses, which produce 43.5% of the country's GDP (GDP)
But either these companies collapse, or people are unable to start any successful ones. One of the main reasons for this is a lack of funds
Employers are let go by commercial companies because of a shortage of cash

Mission :

Business Relief Portal is developed to aid in the expansion and development of startups and small companies

The main aim of Business Relief Portal is to :
Aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small business concerns
Preserve free competitive enterprise
Maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our nation
Help business firms to retain their employee in times of crises

Proposed Solution : 

We created a platform that aids businesses in obtaining money from the government and lenders in order to  assist people with their startups or existing businesses.
As a result, a lot of organizations receive funding, which boosts the nation's economy.
Both new and existing businesses are eligible to register on the platform and submit their proposals.
Our portal provides a variety of Businesses sponsored by lenders and the government, and we can add new Businesses if lenders want to support further businesses.
Proposal Management Enterprise verifies the business proposals in our system, and if they comply with the terms and conditions, they are authorized.
Different funders have the option to invest money in both the company of their choosing and a legitimate commercial organization.
In order to prevent us from falling for con artists, our portal is effective enough to verify the lending institutions as well as corporate companies.
